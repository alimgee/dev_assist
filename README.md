This is project is part of the 'Full Stack Dev Milestone Project 4' module of the Code Institute Full Stack Software Development course, and is the final project of the course. The website intends to mimic a forum type environment where registered users can raise technical queries and respond to other users queries, with an ecommerce option to donate funds to the site creators. Python, Django, Bootstrap and Stripe technologies will be used to achieve this. The marks from this project contribute to the receipt of a diploma level award. The site can be accessed from https://dev-assist.herokuapp.com/
<br>
This site is purely for educational purposes only and does not provide any services. Do not enter personal information. The Ecommerce backend uses the test version of Stripe and will only work using the test stripe credit card number 4242424242424242, see https://stripe.com/docs/testing for test card details.

**Topography**

The site uses bootstrap 4 to be fully responsive across multiple devices, also some media queries were used to change how the intro text appears across different devices to provide a smooth user experience.

### Wireframes

WIreFames were created using balsamiq tool with license key provided by the Code Institute. https://balsamiq.com/ and came be found in the  [/documentation ](/documentation) folder.  The wireframes were created at the very start of the project. Throughout development scope changed,  i adjusted the layouts as appropriate to the projects end goals, there were also new pages added to accommodate journeys not initially thought of that became needed as the project progressed.

## Testing

  

I worked in sprints so every task was manually tested thoroughly via flash() messages or expected behaviors. I used my own kanban board with a small whiteboard and Post Its to track tasks. After each task completion, I would fully test it before moving on to the next task.

```diff
- TODO
further test details on unittesting here
```

  

When the project was fully completed i went through the below testing scenarios to further test the project.

  

| Test | Expected |Passed |
| :------------- |:-------------| :-----:|
| User loads the landing page of site | Page displays without error and reviews can be viewed | &#9745; |
```diff
- TODO
Add testcases.
```

## Deployment

I personally used vscode on my local machine to develop the site using Python 3.7.3  and deployed to Heroku via Github.

1. To download or clone the site to your local machine you will need to go to my [repo](https://github.com/alimgee/book-review-milestone-project3) see steps in https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository .
2.  Before you download or clone the site you will need to ensure you have [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. 
3. Once you have Python installed, created a virtual environment as appropriate to you chosen IDE and os.
```diff
- TODO
Additonal steps to deploy here.
